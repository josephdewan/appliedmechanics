          Centripetal Locking To Reduce Angular Acceleration of The Head During
          Impact
        </h1>
        <h1 id="introdiction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          During a blunt impact, both linear and angular acceleration is
          introduced to the head. Depending on where the impact occurs, the head
          can rotate at an accelerated speed and the neck will not be able to
          compensate for the force. Injuries can occur within the neck region,
          which is not usually considered when imagining an impact directly on
          the head. Numerous variables can contribute to a concussion such as
          shearing, loading of the skull, brain deformation etc. The problems
          caused by angular acceleration should be examined thoroughly. A
          centripetal locking mechanism was developed to actuate a certain
          angular acceleration due to centripetal forces to prevent the head
          from rotating any further. This was attached to a wire which ran
          through a system of 3D-printed parts to the side of a helmet. The
          force vector acts perpendicular to the impact, reducing the angular
          acceleration of the head and neck would decrease the injuries that a
          person receives exponentially.

        <h2 id="1.">1. Theory</h2>
        <p>
          Research conducted by Rowan and others published in 2012 used
          accelerometers on 355 football players and observed the impacts on the
          head during games. They were able to record more than 300,000
          subconcussive and 57 concussive impacts. They state that an angular
          velocity of 28.3 rad/s and an angular acceleration of 6383 rad/s2
          could lead to a 50% chance of a concussion. The subconcussive
          threshold velocity and acceleration were established to be 5.5 rad/s
          and 1230 rad/s2, respectively. Using linear regression lines that
          measured the impact of concussions, they were able to calculate the
          appropriate constant for the risk equation below $$ Risk = {1 \over 1
          + e^{-(\alpha + \beta x)}} \tag{1} \label{riskeq} $$ where &alpha; =
          −12.531 and &beta; = 0.002 (Rowson et al. 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, any acceleration removed from the body will reduce the risk of
          injury by an exponential amount. The question to answer is how to
          lower the acceleration of the head after a certain critical value is
          reached. One solution is a centripetal locking mechanism, which is a
          system that locks when a specific angular acceleration is achieved. If
          one were to attach this mechanism to the head and constrain it from
          accelerating past a certain threshold, it could save a person from
          receiving a concussion and ultimately, long-term brain damage. This
          system is most commonly used in seat belts in cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          In seat belts, the force is transmitted through the belt onto the
          locking mechanism which is attached to the car. When the lock is
          activated, both the human and the object are connected to one singular
          body. Now imagine that this mechanism is attached to the head and
          connected to the body. Before the impact, we can use Newton’s second
          law of motion for rotational bodies which can be represented as $$
          \tau = I\alpha \tag{2} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Where &tau; is the torque, <i>I</i> is the rotational inertia, and
          &alpha; is the angular acceleration. The angular acceleration is
          unknown as impacts are unavoidable, hence this cannot be changed and
          should be used as a given. Therefore, to reduce the total angular
          acceleration on the head we must increase <i>I</i>. If the mechanism
          performs correctly, then when an object hits the side of the face, the
          lock should instantly stop the head from accelerating past a specific
          value. This lock will be connected to the body and the total mass will
          increase which will consequently increase <i>I</i>. To represent this
          more clearly, first start with the torque introduced by the initial
          impact. $$ \tau_{initial} = I_{initial}\alpha_{initial} \tag{3} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce angular acceleration we must add a larger I value as stated
          above, we do this by introducing the rest of the body, not just the
          head, to the equation because adding mass will result in a much higher
          rotational inertia. The torque does not change because it was
          initiated during impact and stays constant during the rotation of the
          head. Hence, the above equation becomes as follows. $$ \tau_{initial}
          = I_{final}\alpha_{final} \tag{3} $$ $$ \tau_{initial} = \tau_{final}
          \rightarrow I_{initial}\alpha_{initial} = I_{final}\alpha_{final}
          \tag{4} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          For this equation to be true given that \(I_{final}>I_{initial}\),
          then final must be smaller than \(\alpha_{initial}\). Thus reducing
          the angular acceleration of the rotating body and preventing damaging
          forces to the head and neck. If the force vector was pointing
          perpendicular to the rotation, it will provide the most torque to
          counteract the rotation due to the impact. A single wire was first
          tested, then two to ensure that the wire will be sufficient to stop
          rotation directions of impact.

          Proceeding to use a software helped the accuracy improve. Uploading
          around 100 images to the software, it took around two hours to
          process. However, the models came out to be more detailed than what
          the app could produce. The diameter error was still in the range of
          12.89%, which is still inaccurate for our standards. The extrusion
          error was less than a percentage, coming around 0.79%. Again, this
          could have been due to the fact that I use these smaller details to
          scale the entire model to the appropriate size. There are no
          limitations on how many images you can upload to the computer
          software, hence, having more images will increase accuracy. This,
          however, will increase the processing time considerably. 100 images
          took around 2 hours and 300 images took around 3.5 hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          As for any experiment, consistency is key when testing different
          techniques during each trial. The dummy with just the torso and head
          was placed at a marked location in the lab with proper orientation of
          the lower body. Similarly, the head was rotated to a marked position.
          The back strap was mounted and a dark background was used in order to
          record footage of each test. A wire was hung from the ceiling to a
          professional soccer ball at 12 PSI. The ball’s height was adjusted to
          ensure that it would impact the head at the same location. The ball
          was then lifted to a height of 1.765 m and released so that it would
          follow the same path every single trial. Finally, a camera was placed
          to record the event at 240 FPS. After the initial setup was completed,
          the impact tests were conducted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this experiment was to test the feasibility of the
          centripetal locking mechanism. Thus, to prove that the concept is
          achievable and beneficial to a human, the tests done during this
          semester were only with taut wires and the mechanism itself was not
          tested.

          Three tests were performed. Firstly, a control experiment had to be
          established as it provided the means for comparison on the upper and
          lower levels of how effective the invention was at reducing angular
          acceleration. The dummy was exposed to a blunt impact without any
          constraints from the back mount. This was considered the maximum
          acceleration during this experiment. Next, a single wire was attached
          to the side where the impact occurred. The wire was attached to the
          side of the helmet and guided towards the back of the mount where it
          was kept taut. Then two wires were placed opposing one another. The
          accelerometer readings were recorded using Blue Trident Sensors. Two
          sensors were located on the right and left side of the head, and one
          was located in the back. With this layout, the data could be evaluated
          for the two largest rotation vectors for the head. Additionally, the
          two sensors on both sides of the face served to compare and mitigate
          the errors arising from the accelerometer being close to the impact.
          This causes extra noise that could sway the results to a higher or
          lower value than what was actually observed. This is a similar
          approach to gathering the data just as the one discussed in (REF). The
          data was downloaded at both 1600 Hz for the raw linear acceleration
          and at 1125 Hz for the angular velocity.
        </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <h2 id="3.">3. Design</h2>
        <p>
          The prototyping and manufacturing of the parts were all created from
          scratch except for the helmet with the sensor housings. The helmet was
          created by Yang Wang, and some minor adjustments were made to create
          mounting holes for the wires to be placed. The main project of the
          research was to design and reengineer a centripetal locking mechanism.
          The second focus was to validate the theory that would prove that this
          device would be effective in reducing angular acceleration. All 3D
          printed parts were created in Solidworks© and printed using Prusa
          MK3S+ printers with PLA plastic (0.4 mm nozzle). Most of the parts
          were created with 15% infill to speed up the manufacturing process.
          Everything created was built around a human-centered design as one day
          a person would wear this device. Additionally, large parts had to be
          manufactured using a 20 cm by 20 cm printing area, so unique designs
          that revolved around part attachments had to be considered. Every
          piece was designed so that it could be adjustable if a different
          height, length, etc. was required without the need to print an
          entirely new part.

        <p>
          In order to increase I, the forces have to transmit to the entire
          body. Therefore, a back mounting area was required in order to attach
          the arms of the wire guides and the centripetal locking mechanism. A
          rough outline of a person’s spinal path was taken and the plate with
          mounting holes was designed. Using 1/4 20 bolts as a default, cuts of
          the head were created so that the bolts would be flush on a person’s
          back, creating more comfort. Moreover, there were 1 in holes for the
          webbing to go through. This webbing would be crucial in keeping the
          system stationary during impact. Inspiration for the webbing design
          was taken from online sources such as the figure above. The webbing
          had two cross sections horizontally to keep it stationary from
          rotational movement and one vertical piece on each shoulder for height
          stability. There was a larger vertical section that increased the
          height of the plate so that another horizontal component could be
          attached. Finally, a segment that was pointing towards the front of
          the body was created. This rested slightly above the shoulders of the
          dummy and it provided the necessary holes so that the forces could be
          directed perpendicular from the head to the lower back.

        <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Centripetal Lock</h3>
        <p>
          Another focus of this research was to create the centripetal locking
          system. Inspiration was first taken from a youtube video of a person
          dismantling one of the seat belt mechanisms. The very first idea was
          to create a part that would move tangentially to the force that was
          being applied just as the video describes. Gear teeth were created
          within a case alongside some other parts including the actual lock,
          rod, upper casing, and friction-reducing plate. The friction reducer
          referred to here is a small plate that sat between the lock and the
          casing. This plate had less surface area; hence, kinetic friction
          would be reduced and the lock would be more sensitive to acceleration.
          However, with the first prototype, the lock did not move tangentially
          and did not activate at all. Even with adjusting the size of the lock
          to be more front-heavy and relocating the center of mass towards the
          edge of the lock, it was still not sufficient for the forces to act
          tangentially in the (theta hat) direction. Since centripetal force is
          given by $$ F = {mv^2 \over r} \mathbf{\hat{r}} \tag{5} $$
        </p>

        <p>
          The arms of the device had to be constrained to move in the \(
          \mathbf{\hat{r}} \) direction. The arms of the lock broke off due to
          rotational testing of the gear shapes and the indents of the arms are
          visible clearly in the pictures below.

          for the lock to move tangentially to the force. <b>A</b> is the
          interal parts of the mechanism. Notice that the two locks had arms
          broken off due to fatigue and stress. This failure point is marked in

          the lock. As displayed above, the lock would rotate in a clockwise
          direction, this would cause radial forces to occur. However, the
          sliding pin joint (blue arrow) was restricted to the tangential
          vector. Hence, there was not a sufficient amount of force in the
          tangential direction and the lock would not operate as intended.

          The second prototype was created given version, V1. This was the first
          real assembled part with an increased arm radius of 2 mm from 1.25 mm.
          Axial stresses are given by the equation $$ \sigma_x = {My \over I}
          \tag{6} $$ where <i>I</i> is the moment of inertia of the
          cross-section of the shape, <i>M</i> is the maximum moment induced,
          and <i>y</i> is the distance from the neutral plane to a point on the
          cross section. For this example, <i>y</i> is the radius of the arm
          since it accounts for the highest amount of stress in the part. For a
          circle, I is \({\pi \over 4} C^4 \) where C is the radius of the
          cross-section. Increasing the radius by 0.75 mm decreased the original
          stress by roughly 75.59% this is because there is a decrease to the
          fourth power as you increase the radius.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, more teeth were included so that the lock would activate at
          a faster rate. This did not work as adding more teeth toward the edges
          of the lock would create torque in the system. During impact, the
          teeth would slide out as expected and the two arms would move radially
          outward. However, as the upper housing kept turning clockwise, the
          right arm would be forced to account for the reaction forces created
          by the force vector arising from the casing teeth impacting the lock.
          Thus, it turned into a pin joint which allowed for rotation. The
          location of the rotation axis would be adjusted. This would create a
          moment on the left arm of the lock and push it counterclockwise,
          releasing it from its locked position entirely. In attempting to solve
          this problem in the second model, the number of teeth was reduced, but
          the original problem still existed.

              Inspecting the figure, the pin joint has been contrained to the
              left side which will cause rotation of the lock only in the
              counterclockwise direction. The

          The solution was to force the desired arm to be a pin joint. This
          prevented that segment from moving down and solely provided rotation
          to the rest of the lock. The forces from the casing teeth provide
          external torque that pushes the lock counterclockwise which resists
          the movement of the rod which is moving clockwise. Version six was the
          first successful implementation of the centripetal locking mechanism.
          Additional changes included the removal of some wings on the plate and
          adding a hex pattern on the rod and upper casing. This hex pattern
          created a rod that could be pressure fitted, so that glue or tools
          were not required to assemble and disassemble the system. This made it
          possible to prototype many minor modifications of the lock.
        </p>

        <p>
          The moment the arm issue was fixed, however, problems arose as the
          gear teeth shape had to be readjusted. During impact, the lock would
          stop the rod from rotating, but the lock would not be fully
          encapsulated in the gear cut. This was the reaction due to the normal
          forces acting normally on the contact surface. This normal vector was
          pointing closer to the center of rotation rather than the tangential
          vector. When the force and distance vector is perpendicular, this will
          yield the highest amount of rotation within the system. It was
          desirable to adjust the very tips of the teeth on the lock. Having a
          flatter approach rather than a curved one was beneficial in directing
          the force vector tangentially to create more torque.
        </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
        <p>
          The final adjustments to the mechanism were first adding a spring to
          unlock the system after the impact had passed. Instead of a
          conventional metal spring, a rubber band was used. This provided more
          adjustability as the pretension could be tuned for the desired level
          of force to radially pull back the lock. Adding a threaded screw so
          that the rubber band can be tied around it allowed for sensitivity
          adjustment. Tightening the screw and consequently adding more tension
          to the rubber band would increase the acceleration at which the lock
          would activate. Conversely, loosening the rubber band would allow it
          to be more sensitive. This final version of the locking mechanism was
          achieved after 13 iterations and adjustments.

          The project consisted of testing the theory of the centripetal locking
          mechanism. The data gathered from the impact tests are listed below.
          The magnitudes of linear acceleration and angular velocity were
          calculated using standard methods. $$ \overrightarrow{a} = \sqrt{a_x^2
          + a_y^2 + a_z^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \overrightarrow{\omega} =
          \sqrt{\omega_x^2 + \omega_y^2 + \omega_z^2} \tag{7} $$ The following
          figures display what the raw data output looks like for all sensors.

          Upon inspection, the data from each sensor sufficiently correlate
          during the trials. Thus, it ensures that the data gathered from the
          side of the impact in relation to the other sensors are still valid to
          use in the analysis. There was minimal noise in the data, as any
          spikes would have been noticed by the figure representations.
          Extracting the x, y, and z components of angular velocity from the
          sensors make it easier to analyze the data and affirm correlation.
          Gathering the magnitude and then computing the maximum values from
          each sensor, the data can be compiled into Tables 1-8, as shown below.

              wire attached. Inspecting the video, you can clearly see that

        <p>
          Gathering data from three locations on the head and extracting the
          angular velocity and linear acceleration, the data supports the idea
          of a centripetal locking mechanism. Firstly, the angular velocity of
          the control trials was theorized to have the highest values as it had
          the least number of forces attempting to stop the impact from
          increasing the velocity. This was not true, as the single wire
          attached to the head achieved the highest angular velocity. This was
          surprising as it should have reduced the angular velocity due to the
          perpendicular force preventing it from rotating. The issue became
          apparent when inspecting the video after the impact, as it created a
          moment on the head and pulled it back at an accelerated rate. This
          contributed to a higher impulse and, consequently, a higher velocity
          and acceleration reading. The linear acceleration readings were also
          higher than the control and inconsistent from trial to trial. This is
          specifically due to the fact that the single wire did not maneuver the
          head in the same path every trial. Hence the acceleration readings
          varied depending on how the head rotated back due to whiplash.

              Video above shows the impact caused by the soccer ball with two
              wires. After impact, the head rotates in the same plane where it
              was initially placed. This eradicated any problems that arose from
              the test done with one wire, i.e. backlash and redireciton of the
              head.

          The two wires did much better in reducing the angular velocity as they
          had the ability to stabilize the head in both directions by
          eliminating any possibility of the head moving towards the chest or
          back. The second wire was theoretically able to absorb half of the
          force presented by the ball during impact. When taking the average
          angular velocity during the control trials and comparing them to the
          averages obtained from the double wire impacts, there is a noticeable
          decrease in values. The angular velocity average for the control trial
          was 17.13 rad/s, while the double wire trials averaged out to be 14.30
          rad/s. This was a reduction of 18.00%, which is amazing considering
          that this could theoretically be the difference between a minor or
          major concussion, depending on the impact. This, however, is still
          significantly off from the theoretical minimum of 9.07 rad/s, which is
          almost another 42.94% difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, the acceleration results were more prominent in
          indicating the acceleration forces on the head during impact. The
          control experiment had an average linear acceleration of 355.99 m/s^2,
          while the double wire had a value of 316.10 m/s^2, which is an 11.87%
          decrease. This measurement is more valuable because force can be
          directly calculated using these values. The absolute minimum
          acceleration was calculated to be around 281.16 m/s^2. The completely
          constrained experiment is only an 11.70% improvement from the ones
          conducted with two wires. The idea of having a single wire must be
          eradicated as it would result in larger acceleration and an increased
          neck strain. Hence, a mechanism that simultaneously stops both wires
          during impact must be developed to reduce the risk of further damage
          to the head and neck. Though angular acceleration was not computed due
          to the rotation vector constantly changing through time and space, the
          peak acceleration gathered from the data is sufficient to indicate
          whether or not the mechanism was able to reduce linear acceleration.
          Since angular and linear acceleration are related by a factor of
          radius, it is fair to assume that this decreased angular acceleration
          by the same factor.

        <h2 id="6.">6. Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          The next steps moving forward would be to first connect a proper wire
          or threaded string to the centripetal locking mechanism. As stated
          above, the steel wiring has the lowest elongation; however, the memory
          of steel made it impossible to wrap it around the eight-millimeter
          shaft for rotation. A possible solution would be to use kevlar as it
          has similar strength and lower weight, but a higher elongation during
          stress testing (Horn et al. 1977). This should not be important during
          the material selection as the force being loaded onto the wire is
          negligible. Furthermore, pre-tensioning the power spring to the proper
          torque so that it eliminates any slack on the line is mandatory.
          Finally, the centripetal lock will be integrated into the back, and
          further impact tests will be conducted.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the testing process, multiple flaws arose that could be
          problematic if someone were to wear it. The weight of the entire
          system was concerning as it can be quite heavy for someone to wear. If
          the previous adjustments yield promising results just as before, then
          progress towards making the locking mechanism and entire back mounting
          area could be sized down. The purpose of making everything thicker and
          larger was to test the theory and have enough margins to adjust the
          equipment due to tolerances and material deformations. Moreover, the
          mechanism will have to be attached to a gear system so that one
          centripetal lock can control both wires so that they can be stopped
          together and prevent any whiplash from occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, this system is only designed for side impacts and is not
          suitable for projectiles impacting the front or back of the head. The
          development of a better system will also be designed for a dummy with
          all body parts attached as it would represent a real human being. This
          would also reduce the angular acceleration even more as it would
          introduce more mass into the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing at what acceleration would the lock activate would also be
          valuable information. Tuning the lock to actuate at a desired angular
          acceleration would prevent the lock from acuating too soon or too
          late. This can also be fine-tuned when more research about the angular
          acceleration of the head is published and more modifications can be
          made to the design.
        </p>

          Lastly, this device is not friendly for a human to wear, hence, parts
          will have to be shrunk and materials will have to be lighter. The
          implementation of the perpendicular force vector without the wire
          guides extruding away from the body will be difficult, but not
          impossible. The wire can be put into sleeves and guided down the neck
          to the shoulders where it will be guided toward the locking mechanism.

        <h2 id="7.">7. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The entirety of the project is to transmit forces that would cause
          rotational energy from the head to the body. The centripetal locking
          mechanism was designed successfully and will be implemented in the
          back mount during later testing. To test the theory, one and two wires
          were attached to the helmet, perpendicular to the impact. This was to
          simulate the lock activating and creating tension through the wires.
          The results validate that a locking system can be utilized to decrease
          angular acceleration during side impacts. With the success of creating
          the lock and validating the theory, more experiments can be conducted
          to completely integrate the two projects together. Applications that
          could utilize this method of protection would be military exercises or
          during athletic play. It allows for full head mobility while still
          offering protection against strain and helps save people from
          long-term brain injuries when implemented properly.
