              Overview: Joseph Dewan is currently an undergraduate researcher studying mechanical engineering at Brown University. He has been working at Professor Kesariâ€™s lab since June 2022 and is currently working on projects related to improving helmet design to reduce forces on the head during a soccer ball impact. Past research projects include improving LiDAR and photogrammetry techniques to create detailed and accurate 3D models.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Designing and prototyping a new a pendulum system to simulate an impact that produces 200g of force onto a mannequin head. I will have to create a wall mounting plate that is completely rigid. The pendulum itself will be contructed using t-slotted frames.

          Fall of 2022
        </h3>
        <p>
          Designing a new helmet design to reduce the forces that are absorbed by the head during a large impact. The proposed plan is to connect the helmet to the body so that a larger massed object can prevent the head from rotating and creating long term spinal and neck damage. A centripetal locking mechanism will be used to allow the head to rotate freely when small accelerations occur, but lock completely to the body when higher accelerations are introduced like during a large impact.

        <p>
          The goal of this research is to obtain 3D scans that 1) contain enough detail to calculate distances and normal vectors, 2) have a sub-millimeter accuracy, and 3) are easily reproducible to the average consumer. This included LiDAR and photogrammetry scanning techniques. Using these methods, we can evaluate accuracies related to helmet manufacturing and stretching due to daily wear.

                Software used to control and process 3D printed parts. This printer is capable of 6 axis printing, milling, wiring, and more. Additionally, it automatically changes the tool for the proper job. This machine enables us to create parts without the need of supports and add electronic connections internally.
