              Overview: Joseph Dewan is currently an undergraduate researcher studying mechanical engineering at Brown University. He has been working at Professor Kesari’s lab since June 2022 and is currently working on projects related to improving helmet design to reduce forces on the head during a soccer ball impact. Past research projects include improving LiDAR and photogrammetry techniques to create detailed and accurate 3D models.

          Designing a new helmet design to reduce the forces that are absorbed by the head during a large impact. The proposed plan is to connect the helmet to the body so that a larger massed object can prevent the head from rotating and creating long term spinal and neck damage.

          The goal of this research is to obtain 3D scans that 1) contain enough detail to calculate distances and normal vectors, 2) have a sub-millimeter accuracy, and 3) are easily reproducible to the average consumer. This included LiDAR and photogrammetry scanning techniques. Using these methods, we can evaluate accuracies related to helmet manufacturing and stretching due to daily wear.

                Used MATLAB code for calculating vectors and normal planes given a set of coordinates for the summer research. Used functions to calculate matrixes and other calculations related to partial differential equations, electrical engineering, fluid dynamics, and static analysis of solid bodies.
